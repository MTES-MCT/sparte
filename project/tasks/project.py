Asyn tasks runned by Celery

Below functions are dedicated to loading a project data and pre calculate
all the indicators required to speedup process
Current process is :
1- Create a new project (or drop any 'emprise')
2- select an emprise form cities, known organization or shape file
    => end of this step mean project as emprise instances (at least one)
3- linked project (or plan) to covered cities
4- Evaluate indicators:
